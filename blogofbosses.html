            The first guy I discussed tech with, very loquacious and misbehaves alot but a great guy. A <i>mad</i> dev, not a python 
            programmer but been invaulable, if not my programming MVP. Created connections for me which led me to a group I found two
            other bosses; <strong>David, Tomisin</strong>(you will get to meet them soon), gives links to courses.
            Wrote my first flask app with a link he sent to me.
            Zubair have money when you see him collect money from him. If you want to know him Google is your friend(Zubair Idris
            Aweda).

            made the connection for me. Always of great help to me, out of her busy schedule still helps me with debugging, gives me 
            advice, even mmaterials to help boost my knowlegde.

            A very fast debugger(code editors and IDE is inside him), very knowlegdeable and smart, <i>Solomon should be added to his name</i>, he crushes any bug coming his
            way. Our connection was established after he helped me with my RegEx question, the very first connection I created myself and
            it's been great knowing the Machine Learning and Petroleum Engineer. Anticipating a better relationship with you boss.
